**The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission contracted Automatidata to predict taxi cab fares before each ride.**

*As a part of the data team , starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Visualization** , I ran an **A/B Test** by analyzing the relationship between credit card payment and total fare amount such that the data team can discover if customers who pay in credit card tend to pay a larger total fare amount than customers who pay in cash. Then I developed a **Multiple Linear Regression model** which estimates taxi cab fares prior to the ride.*
